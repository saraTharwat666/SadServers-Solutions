Scenario: "Quito": Control One Container from Another

Level: Medium

Type: Do

Access: Email

Description: You have a running container named docker-access. Another container nginx is present but in a stopped state. Your goal is to start the nginx container from inside the docker-access container.

You must not start the nginx container from the host system or any other container that is not docker-access. You can restart this docker-access container.

Test: Executing docker ps inside the docker-access container: docker exec docker-access docker ps succeeds.

The "Check My Solution" button runs the script /home/admin/agent/check.sh, which you can see and execute.
