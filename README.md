## 📌 What's happening here?
This repository is a collection of hands-on solutions for broken infrastructure. Each directory contains a deep dive into a specific system failure—ranging from Docker container crashes and networking bottlenecks to PostgreSQL replication mismatches.

The focus is on **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: finding why the system is "sad" and implementing the most efficient fix to bring it back to a healthy state.

- **Log Hunting:** Digging through `journalctl` and `docker logs` to spot the error.
- **Environment Auditing:** Checking system parameters, file descriptors, and network ports.
- **Patching & Optimization:** Fixing the config and ensuring it doesn't break again.
