## 📌 Overview
This repository contains hands-on debugging scenarios for broken systems and infrastructure.  
Each directory represents a real-world failure case and documents the investigation and fix.

The focus is on **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** — understanding *why* the system failed, not just how to restart it.
